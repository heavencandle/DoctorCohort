# CVPR_2024_SpatialTracker_Tracking Any 2D Pixels in 3D Space

## Sumary
- Motion estimation's two main paradigms: feature tracking, optical flow
  - optical flow only produces motion for adjacent frames & feature tracking only tracks sparse pixels
- Goal: dense and long-range pixel trajectories in a video
- Proposal: Lift 2D pixels into 3D and perform tracking in the 3D space
